# Schedule Checker
This python script is meant as a notification tool for FSU class schedules. It is by no means meant 
for any malicious purposes.

There are a couple dependencies needed to make this all work properly, I will assume the user has python and pip
installed on ther machine.

Run the follwoing commands from the command line (assuming your path variables are correctly set)
`pip install selenium`
and
`pip install time`
and 
`pip install smtplib`
as well as
`pip install beautifulsoup4`


After setting up the appropriate dependencies, copy the code over to your notepad and then fill in the 
variables at the top of the screen with your data


Run the navigateToPage.py by issuing the command:
`python navigateToPage`

And that's it! Leave this guy running in the background and you will be notified via email when your class is available
